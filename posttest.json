        "c": "Greater",
        "d": "Smaller"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "A projection is always equal to or shorter than the actual line due to foreshortening."

      "question": "If a line is 40mm long and is inclined at 30° from hp and parallel to VP then its projection in HP is?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The top view (HP projection) = 40 × cos(30°) = 34.64mm."

      "question": "If the projection of a line is a point in HP. It means?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Line is parallel to both HP and VP",

      "question": "If a line is in VP, which view from the following gives the actual length of the line AB?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Top view",
        "b": "Side view",
        "c": "Front view",
        "d": "Bottom view"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Since the line lies in VP, the front view shows its true length."
